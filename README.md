# ft_containers
Re-implementation of some STL containers to better understand them

To pass this project, our containers can be up to 20x slower than the standard containers in the STL.
An extremely lenient requirement, but I'm very proud of the way I optimized mine so it is only 33% slower than the original (give or take).
